## Testing ideas

How about if we were to take a citation in markdown, converted to html with pandoc with --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography bibliography/biblio.bib and then changed things? Would it be a little easier?

Say take Sebastian Sauer's paper [@sauermaking] and convert it to html with Pandoc options and then change the code in the html? No it won't.
