We are not going to use markdown or latex on Authorea's editor, just plain html. We will work on the backend at the local machine. So, we make changes here, then import them or pull them into our folder, convert the document to markdown, preserve the citation tags, and perhaps table tags as well as these are not well translated by pandoc, and work on the markdown document some more and then add references and citations from the markdownified local document and push it back. This forward and backward pushing is needed to test that markdown at the machine level and html at Authorea level should work. The only non-pleb level changes that need to be done should be at the html level with citations where we need to add the cite tag with class equals ltx_cite raw v1 within quotes and close the tag but that can be done using an edit find and replace kind of automated script or step for large number of citations. Hopefully, pandoc will preserve all cite tags during parse raw unless I am too ambitious.
