We are not going to use markdown or latex on Authorea's editor, just plain html. We will work on the backend at the local machine. So, we make changes here, then import them or pull them into our folder, convert the document to markdown, preserve the citation tags, and perhaps table tags as well as these are not well translated by pandoc, and work on the markdown document some more and then add references and citations from the markdownified local document and push it back.

<h2 id="then-we-continue-to-work-some-more">then we continue to work some more</h2>
<p>Now add a table and image and that kind of thing and it should work. Just make sure that two backslashes not one backslash in markdown and use --parse-raw as option. Add a citation here, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{sauermaking}</cite> to make things easy.</p>
