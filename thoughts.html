<h2>What did I learn from failed experiments</h2><div>If I create a markdown block and push it through git, it may work.</div><div>Perhaps create a structure with html or insert text first. Then pull and push from github?</div><div>If I create a new html file and add to layout.md and upload will it work?</div><h2>Create a table and push it with a new file</h2><div><table><thead><tr><th>X</th><th>Y</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td> <td>B</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>This is a table.
