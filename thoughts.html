All other text elements will work likewise.</div><div>How about citations?</div><div>Create folder bibliography and then within it biblio.bib and put in root folder Then populate the file with a reference from Google scholar, say the Git article by Karthik Ram and instead of using pandoc to process the citation, I add the cite command <cite>\cite{ram2013}</cite> and continue with it to process the html.</div><div>Changed the cite command.

Now I want to bring in the file to my local repo (git pull?), create a thoughts2.md and append those few lines to the html file.</div><div>Now if I went ahead and placed another reference and then modified the thoughts2.html using the cite class equals ltx_cite raw v1 within quote marks, would this work?</div><div>Say we cite Leonard's work <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{leonard2016}</cite> then went ahead and modified this document on thoughts2.html, appended as before and tested. Would it work?</div><div></div><div>So far I am enjoying the workflow in Authorea and Atom with git and pandoc. It can be frustrating at times, but if it can be made to work, nothing like it. We are not going to use markdown or latex on Authorea's editor, just plain html. We will work on the backend at the local machine. So, we make changes here, then import them or pull them into our folder, convert the document to markdown, preserve the citation tags, and perhaps table tags as well as these are not well translated by pandoc, and work on the markdown document some more and then add references and citations from the markdownified local document and push it back. This forward and backward pushing is needed to test that mrkdo</div>
