<p>If I create a markdown block and push it through git, it may work.</p>
<p>Perhaps create a structure with html or insert text first. Then pull and push from github?</p>
<p>If I create a new html file and add to layout.md and upload will it work?</p>
<h2 id="create-a-table-and-push-it-with-a-new-file">Create a table and push it with a new file</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>X</th>
<th>Y</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a table. Now convert thoughts.md to thoughts.html and add to layout.md Then git it to authorea. Works?</p>
<p>Yes it did work. Figure will work likewise. All other text elements will work likewise.</p>
<p>How about citations?</p>
<p>Create folder bibliography and then within it biblio.bib and put in root folder Then populate the file with a reference from Google scholar, say the Git article by Karthik Ram and instead of using pandoc to process the citation, I add the cite command  and continue with it to process the html.</p>
