<p>If I create a markdown block and push it through git, it may work.</p>
<p>Perhaps create a structure with html or insert text first. Then pull and push from github?</p>
<p>If I create a new html file and add to layout.md and upload will it work?</p>

<table>

<tr class="header">
<th>X</th>
<th>Y</th>

<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>

<p>This is a table. Now convert thoughts.md to thoughts.html and add to layout.md Then git it to authorea. Works?</p>
