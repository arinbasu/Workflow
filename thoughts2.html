<p>So, I changed the file on Authorea and added citations. Now I want to bring in the file to my local repo (git pull?), create a thoughts2.md and append those few lines to the html file.</p>
<p>Now if I went ahead and placed another reference and then modified the thoughts2.html using the cite class equals ltx_cite raw v1 within quote marks, would this work?</p>
<p>Say we cite Leonard's work \cite{leonard2016} then went ahead and modified this document on thoughts2.html, appended as before and tested. Would it work?</p>
