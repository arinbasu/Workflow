## What did I learn from failed experiments

If I create a markdown block and push it through git, it may work.

Perhaps create a structure with html or insert text first. Then pull and push from github?

If I create a new html file and add to layout.md and upload will it work?

## Create a table and push it with a new file

| X | Y |
|---|---|
| A | B |

This is a table.
Now convert thoughts.md to thoughts.html and add to layout.md
Then git it to authorea. Works?
