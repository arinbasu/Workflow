## What did I learn from failed experiments

If I create a markdown block and push it through git, it may work.

Perhaps create a structure with html or insert text first. Then pull and push from github?

If I create a new html file and add to layout.md and upload will it work?

## Create a table and push it with a new file

| X | Y |
|---|---|
| A | B |

This is a table.
Now convert thoughts.md to thoughts.html and add to layout.md
Then git it to authorea. Works?

Yes it did work. Figure will work likewise. All other text elements will work likewise.

How about citations?

Create folder bibliography and then within it biblio.bib and put in root folder
Then populate the file with a reference from Google scholar, say the Git article by Karthik Ram and instead of using pandoc to process the citation, I add the cite command \cite{ram2013} and continue with it to process the html.
